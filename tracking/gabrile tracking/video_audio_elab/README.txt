Tracking of active sensing ro-bat in the arena with obstacles
If not specified otherwise, the naming scheme for all files is yyyymmdd_hh-mm-ss._extension_, indicating the date and time in which the file was generated/catalogued.

Folders:

- analysis
    yaml documents containing the ground truth obstacle distance, the distance error, the ground truth angle and the angle error as lists generated by a blind tracking of the robot

- audio:
    eight-channel .wav audio recorded by the robot during the run. Fs = 176400 Hz

- control:
    .mp4 videos of the robot travelling in an empty arena

- non_blind_analysis:
    yaml files containing the same as in analysis, but referred to the obstacle that matches the most the robot's finding

- offsets:
    yaml files containing the starting point of reading into the audio files generated by the robot and the number of samples read

- output:
    .mp4 videos generated by the tracking scripts

- plots:
    .png of the plots showcasing the data collected and analyzed

- trajectories: 
    yaml files containing the position of the center of the robot's marker in the video frames, plus the pixel per meters conversion factor for each video analyzed
    Are used for computing the heatmaps in the relative script

- trajectories_control:
    same as above but for the empty arena control runs

- unused_data:
    self-explanatory

-videos:
    .MP4 videos coming from the GoPro Hero 11 of the robot runs in the arena
