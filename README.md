# ðŸ¦‡ðŸ¤– **Ro-Bat Project**  
*Bio-Inspired Swarm of Robots with Echolocation and Audio-Based Localization*

## **Overview**  
This repository contains work related to the **Ro-Bat Project**, developed at the **Center for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour** at the **University of Konstanz**.  

The project focuses on creating a **bio-inspired swarm of robots** to:  
1. Study bats' echolocation behavior within groups of conspecifics (members of the same species).  
2. Develop **audio-based localization systems** for swarm robotics.  

---

## **Objectives**  
- **Understand Echolocation:** Simulate and study how bats use echolocation to navigate and interact in groups.  
- **Swarm Robotics:** Implement a robotic system that mimics biological swarm behavior.  
- **Audio Localization:** Develop algorithms for accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using audio signals.  

---

## **Technical Details**  
The project uses **Direction of Arrival (DOA) algorithms** for audio-based localization:  
1. **Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT)**  
2. **Steered Response Power with Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT)**  
3. **Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)**
